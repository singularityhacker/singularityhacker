## About

I’m an operator and technologist with 15+ years across software engineering, large-scale agile programs, and Web3-native organizations.

My work sits at the intersection of **code, incentives, and governance**. I’ve founded and scaled on-chain protocols, designed DAO grant systems, built bonding-curve launch infrastructure, and shipped agent-based automation that connects on-chain primitives with real-world execution.
